Digital Recipe Book MERN Stack Application
This project is a digital recipe book where a user can save recipes along with their ingredients, directions, and prep time to their account (they'll log in, or sign up if they don't have an account yet), and. It is designed to replace paper books in order to be more efficient and easy-to-use than a traditional cookbook, such that a user can simply log on and view/add recipes. This encourages more diverse culinary/dietary intake. Future intended additions to this application is to incorporate a "Meal Plan" button which randomly selects 3 breakfast, lunch, and dinner recipes (one of each type) from the user's database to make a meal plan for the day, with an optional dessert as well. This would reduce time and effort it takes to meal plan for the user, while simultaenously providing a meal plan with food the user actually likes, since they are the ones who added it. Over the course of time, there will be a great collection of recipes, and randomizing a meal plan will become that much more fun!
