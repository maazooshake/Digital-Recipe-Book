# Digital Recipe Book MERN Stack Application

This project is a digital recipe book where a user can log in to their account, or sign up if they dont' have one yet, and save recipes along with their ingredients, directions, and prep time to their account. It is designed to replace paper books in order to be more efficient and easy-to-use than a traditional cookbook, such that a user can simply log on and view/add recipes. This encourages more diverse culinary/dietary intake. Future intended additions to this application is to incorporate a "Meal Plan" button which randomly selects 3 breakfast, lunch, and dinner recipes (one of each type) from the user's database to make a meal plan for the day, with an optional dessert as well. This would reduce time and effort it takes to meal plan for the user, while simultaenously providing a meal plan with food the user actually likes, since they are the ones who added it. Over the course of time, there will be a great collection of recipes, and randomizing a meal plan will become that much more fun! 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
